# Reinforcement-Learning-For-Bus-Routes
Reinforcement learning to find the best bus routes in Singapore for route planning. This functions similar to how Google Maps would recommend which bus to take if you want to travel from one destination to another.

## Requirements

- numpy
- networkx
- matplotlib
- folium (To see the bus stop nodes on the map)
- imageio (for generating the video/gif file to visualize)
- imageio-ffmpeg ( for generating the video/gif file to visualize)

To install them, try:

`Pip install networkx matplotlib imageio imageio-ffmpeg folium`

## API Usages
1. API to get BUS ROUTES
2. API to get BUS STOPS
3. API to convert Postal Code to Latitude Longtitude values  


## Examples
